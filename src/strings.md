### Sentence Analyzer Program

Create sentence analyzer program that tells the user how many vowels and consonants were used.

**Example:**

input - ```"The hill are alive."```

output - ```5 vowels and 10 consonants```

### Command Line Calculator

The program should welcome the user, prompt them for a calculation,
and give the result. The user should be prompted after each result is
outputted if they want to enter another calculation. When they
say no, give them an exit message. Allow the user first to specify 
how many operands they will enter. Do not worry about 
input validation (assume user enters correct data type).

Example program:

```
WELCOME TO THE CALCULATOR APP!!! (program output)

Do you wish to enter a new calculation? (program output)
yes (user inputs this)

How many operands will you calculate? (program output)
2 (user inputs this)

Please enter a calculation: (program output)
2 + 2 (user enters this or something like this)
The output of 2 + 2 is 4. (program outputs this)

Do you wish to enter a new calculation? (program outputs this)
no (user enters this)

GOODBYE!!!

```
