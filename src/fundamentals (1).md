1. Write a program in Java to read 10 numbers from keyboard and find their sum
   and average

    ```
    Expected Output :
    The sum of 10 numbers is : 55
    The Average is : 5.500000
    ```

1. Write a program in Java to display the cube of the number upto given an
   integer. Read the number using the `Scanner` class.

    ```
    Expected Output :
    Number is : 1 and cube of the 1 is :1
    Number is : 2 and cube of the 2 is :8
    Number is : 3 and cube of the 3 is :27
    Number is : 4 and cube of the 4 is :64
    Number is : 5 and cube of the 5 is :125
    ```

1. Write a program in Java to display the n terms of odd natural number and
   their sum. Read the odd number using the `Scanner` class

    ```
    Test Data
    Input number of terms : 10
    Expected Output :
    The odd numbers are :1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
    The Sum of odd Natural Number upto 10 terms : 100
    ```

1. Write a program in Java to display the pattern like right angle triangle with
   a number. Read the number using the `Scanner` class.

    ```
    The pattern like :

    1
    12
    123
    1234
    ```

1. Write a program in Java to make such a pattern like right angle triangle with
   number increased by 1.

    ```
    With an input of 10.
    The pattern must look like :
