### Simple Chat Bot

Be creative in communicating with your
 user different options and for given scenerios. Create at three phases of the chat, for example...
			
			                 "How are you?" (AI says)
			           |                              |
			         good                        bad (user types)
				                                      
	   "Awesome! Are you super happy?" 	    "Will cake make you better?"  
		      						                         
	          yes          no                     yes             no
  
Keep the chat options relatively simple and plan it out clearly before coding it.
